Thank you for using my app!!! ❤️

## Usage
Once installed, you can enter anybody's name and it will tell you how many finals they need until each milestone. The milestones are the next whole number (3), the next tenth (2.4), and the next hundreth (2.33).

## API Warning
Every Hypixel player has access to the free public API with a limit of 120 queries a minute. There is also a limit on how often you can look up the same player in a 2-5 minute perious (I'm not sure exactly how long). Abuse of this limit **can result in an API ban, or even a server ban. I am not responsible for any consequences from using this program**
